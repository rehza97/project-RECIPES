    <h1>How to Cook a Turkey</h1>
    <p>You'll be glad to know that cooking a turkey is surprisingly easy. Even with just a little bit of prep, you'll get great results you can be proud of. Here's how to prepare a thawed turkey for roasting in the oven:</p>

        <li> <h2>Prep the Turkey</h2> <p>Unwrap the plastic around your turkey over the sink to ensure that any juices will run down the drain. Remove the packet of giblets from the cavity of the bird and save them for gravy or stuffing. Next, use paper towels to pat dry the bird inside and out.

        <li> <h2>Stuff the Turkey (Optional)</h2> <p>If you are stuffing the turkey, stuff it loosely, allowing about ½ to ¾ cup stuffing per pound of turkey. While stuffing a turkey is traditional (and picturesque), it has become less and less common over the years for a number of reasons. Most importantly, cooking your stuffing to 165 degrees F likely means that you'll over-cook the rest of the bird. </p>  <img src="/img/tur3.jpg" width="500px"> </li>
